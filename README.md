# rust-digital-living-art

This is a re-imagining of [this repo](https://github.com/CatOrganization/raspberry-pi-audio-visualizer) in Rust and on broader terms.

Currently, it only supports audio visualization, but the scope might grow as I feel inspired (or not idk).

This is a work-in-progress and may or may not work on your system.

Theoretically a `cargo run` will get it up and running, but no promises.
